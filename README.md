# Inertial Measurement Unit Fall Detection

## 0) Research

Before starting any project, I always research information to better understand the problem and avoid reinventing the wheel. I enjoy bridging the gap between scientific publications and the project at hand, as this saves implementation time, reveals what has and hasn't worked in research, allows for analysis of strategies used in papers, and enables their adaptation to our project.
<br>All of this translates into better and more agile delivery times.
